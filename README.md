# CSE 170 - Removing Barriers to Learning Studio Project
Have you ever had a professor you couldn’t understand? Was it an accent or were they too soft? Or maybe they used vocabulary unfamiliar to you? Whatever the cause, students need a way to understand what the professor is saying to learn. Using ProfScribe, they can do just that – with real-time subtitles of the professor’s speech in the lecture hall live or after the lecture. Also, for non-native speakers, subtitles can be translated to their primary language. Now, every student can comprehend the professor!

## App Walkthrough
* In the login screen, you have the option to sign in with your university email account as well as facebook.
* At the home screen, you can see a list of lectures with the course title, professor name and topic. The drop down helps you switch between courses.
* We notice that a lecture is live right now - Let us pretend that I'm a Professor. It listens to my voice. And it converts speech to text in real time. We can convert these transcripts to any language. Let’s try Hind.
Now let’s go back to the home page.
* Similarly, we are able view previously recorded lectures. We can see the video of a prior lecture, the subtitles right below it and the corresponding transcript. In the options setting, we can toggle the sections displayed. Let's try changing the language to Korean and increasing the font size.
* We are also able to add or delete languages in the Profile screen. Let's add Spanish and save. The application will remember this.
* There is a detailed help section about how to use this application effectively.
* Finally we log out of the app.
